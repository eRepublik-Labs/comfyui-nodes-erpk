**Concatenate Strings features:**
- 10 connectable text inputs (Text 1 through Text 10)

### Shared Workflows (Multi-User)

In multi-user ComfyUI (`--multi-user`), each user's workflows are sandboxed. Shared Workflows provides a common directory where any user can save, browse, load, and delete workflow templates. Also works in single-user mode.

**Access:** Right-click the canvas > **ERPK** submenu, or open **ERPK Settings** to see the inline shared workflows list below your API keys.

- **Browse Shared Workflows...** - View all shared workflows with name, size, date, and authorship (created by / last edited by). Load any workflow into your canvas or delete it.
- **Share Current Workflow...** - Save the current canvas workflow to the shared directory. The name field is pre-populated from the current workflow tab.
- **Save to "[name]"** - Appears after loading or sharing a workflow. Saves directly to the linked shared workflow without opening a dialog.
- **Settings panel** - The ERPK Settings panel shows an inline shared workflows list with Load, Delete, and Share Current buttons.

**Linked save-back:** When you load a shared workflow or share one, the workflow name is linked. Subsequent edits can be pushed back to the shared copy via the "Save to" menu item. Other users see the updated version when they browse.

**Authorship tracking:** Each shared workflow records who created it and who last modified it. On overwrite, the original creator is preserved while the modifier is updated.

**Toast notifications:** Success/error feedback appears as a brief toast in the top-right corner for all save, load, and delete operations.

**Storage:** Workflows are saved as JSON files in `shared_workflows/` under the ComfyUI base directory (e.g., `~/Documents/ComfyUI/shared_workflows/`), alongside `input/`, `output/`, and `models/`. This location persists across plugin upgrades and ComfyUI restarts. Falls back to the extension directory when running outside ComfyUI. Each file uses an envelope format (`{meta, workflow}`) that stores authorship metadata alongside the workflow graph. No API keys or user-specific data are stored.

**API Endpoints:**

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/erpk/shared_workflows` | GET | List all shared workflows (metadata including authorship) |
| `/erpk/shared_workflows/{name}` | GET | Get a single workflow by name |
| `/erpk/shared_workflows` | POST | Save a workflow (`{name, workflow}`); records user as author |
| `/erpk/shared_workflows/{name}` | DELETE | Delete a workflow by name |

### SaveImage Metadata Toggle

Adds a **strip_metadata** toggle to ComfyUI's built-in SaveImage node (and PreviewImage, which inherits it). When enabled, both the workflow JSON and prompt data are stripped from saved PNG files, producing clean images with no embedded ComfyUI metadata.

- **Per-node control** - Each SaveImage node gets its own boolean toggle; no global setting needed
- **Off by default** - Metadata is preserved unless you explicitly enable stripping
- **Prompt metadata also stripped** - Both `extra_pnginfo` (workflow graph) and `prompt` (API-format node data) are removed when enabled

### Auto-Clear Job History

Automatically removes completed jobs from the history panel after each run. Prevents the UI from slowing down during long sessions with many queued generations.

- **Off by default** - Enable via **Settings > ERPK > General > Auto-Clear Job History**
- **Delayed cleanup** - Waits 5 seconds after job completion so the frontend can fetch results before the history entry is removed
- **No restart needed** - Toggling the setting takes effect on the next completed job

## Installation

### Method 1: ComfyUI Manager (Recommended)

1. Open ComfyUI Manager
2. Click **Install Custom Nodes**
3. Search for `erpk`
4. Find **ERPK Custom Nodes** and click **Install**
5. Restart ComfyUI

### Method 2: ComfyUI Registry

Install directly from the [ComfyUI Registry](https://registry.comfy.org/publishers/erpk/nodes/comfyui-nodes-erpk) web interface.

### Method 3: Manual Installation

1. Navigate to your ComfyUI custom_nodes directory:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/ComfyUI/custom_nodes/
   ```

2. Clone this repository as `erpk`:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eRepublik-Labs/comfyui-nodes-erpk.git erpk
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd erpk
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Restart ComfyUI

### Post-Installation

1. Configure API keys for the services you want to use.
   The easiest way is via right-click on the canvas > **ERPK Settings**, or **Settings > ERPK > API Keys** in ComfyUI -- keys are stored per-user and never saved in workflows.

   API keys are resolved in priority order:
   1. **ComfyUI Settings** (recommended) -- right-click canvas > ERPK Settings
   2. **Widget input** -- api_key field on client/config nodes
   3. **Environment variable** -- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `WAVESPEED_API_KEY`
   4. **Config file** -- `provider/config.ini`

   **Multi-user support:** In multi-user ComfyUI installations, each user's API keys are stored separately in their own `comfy.settings.json`. The correct user's keys are resolved automatically during workflow execution. A "Current user: [name]" banner appears in the ERPK Settings panel when multi-user mode is active.

   - **WaveSpeed:** See [wavespeed/README.md](wavespeed/README.md#installation)
   - **Claude:** See [claude/README.md](claude/README.md#installation)
   - **Gemini:** See [gemini/README.md](gemini/README.md#installation)
   - **OpenAI:** See [openai/README.md](openai/README.md#installation)
   - **Apple/SHARP:** No API keys required. Install with: `pip install git+https://github.com/apple/ml-sharp.git`

2. Find nodes under their respective categories: `ERPK/WaveSpeedAI`, `ERPK/Claude`, `ERPK/Gemini`, `ERPK/OpenAI`, `ERPK/Apple/SHARP`, and `ERPK/utils`

## Backward Compatibility

This package uses the ComfyUI V3 node API. Saved workflows that reference older node IDs (e.g. `"WaveSpeed Custom SeedreamV4"`, `"ERPK SHARP Predict"`) are automatically migrated to the current node IDs at load time via ComfyUI's NodeReplace system. No manual workflow editing is required.

## ComfyUI API Integration

ComfyUI provides a REST API that allows programmatic workflow creation and execution. This is useful for automation, testing, and integration with external tools.

### Available Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/system_stats` | GET | System information (OS, RAM, GPU, versions) |
| `/object_info` | GET | List all available nodes and their input/output types |
| `/prompt` | POST | Queue a workflow for execution |
| `/queue` | GET | View pending and running jobs |
| `/history` | GET | View execution history and results |
| `/history/{prompt_id}` | GET | Get results for a specific execution |

### Submitting a Workflow via API

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8188/prompt \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": {
      "1": {
        "class_type": "GeminiAPIConfig",
        "inputs": {
          "api_key": ""
        }
      },
      "2": {
        "class_type": "GeminiTextGeneration",
        "inputs": {
          "client": ["1", 0],
          "prompt": "Write a haiku about ComfyUI",
          "model": "gemini-2.5-flash",
          "temperature": 0.7,
          "max_tokens": 256
        }
      },
      "3": {
        "class_type": "PreviewAny",
        "inputs": {
          "source": ["2", 0]
        }
      }
    }
  }'
```

**Note:** The port may vary (8000 for desktop app, 8188 for standard installation).

### Workflow JSON Format

Workflows can be saved as JSON files in your ComfyUI workflows directory. The format includes:

- `nodes`: Array of node definitions with `id`, `type`, `pos`, `inputs`, `outputs`, and `widgets_values`
- `links`: Array of connections in format `[link_id, source_node, source_slot, target_node, target_slot, type]`
- `last_node_id` / `last_link_id`: Tracking for ID generation

### Checking Available Nodes

```bash
# List all ERPK nodes
curl -s http://localhost:8188/object_info | jq 'keys' | grep -i -E "(gemini|claude|openai)"
```
